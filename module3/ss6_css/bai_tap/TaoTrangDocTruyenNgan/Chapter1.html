    A timeline of historical events in the Inazuma region. References are provided as much as possible. There are also notes that expand on the deduction and reasoning used to draw certain conclusions, which can be read by either hovering over (desktop-only) or clicking on the note. Some specific types of notes found on the page:

    Lore Discrepancy: When information provided in the game is self-contradictory, retroactively changed, or contradicts manga information, it is considered a lore discrepancy. This is different from a translation discrepancy, in which information is contradictory or misleading due to inaccuracies in localization. In the case of a lore discrepancy involving information found in-game and in the manga, the in-game information always takes priority.
    Translation Note: Used when the original Chinese text and its official English translation do not match, or if something is clearer in Chinese. In the case of a translation discrepancy, the original Chinese text always takes priority.
    Assumptions: Because of lack of information, contradictory information, information that is expanded on in different lore pieces, deliberately inaccurate in-game material, and other such obfuscation, editors will sometimes make assumptions to determine the order of certain events or puzzle together pieces of disjointed lore. However, they may be obsoleted and proven incorrect by new lore and story. These notes serve as a disclaimer, and expand on the editors' reasoning for their conclusions.
    If you have any proposed changes for the timeline, please leave a comment and cite your evidence.
